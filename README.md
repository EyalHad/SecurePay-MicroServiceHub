### **Description**
**SecurePay MicroHub is a cloud-native microservices system designed to handle user authentication and payment operations securely and efficiently. It provides a scalable backend for user registration, JWT-based authentication, deposits, and money transfers, with asynchronous event publishing via Kafka. Deployed on Kubernetes using Docker containers, the system ensures high availability and modernizes legacy conventions through event-driven architecture and container orchestration.**

---

### **Goal**
**The goal of SecurePay MicroHub is to demonstrate expertise in designing and implementing a secure, scalable microservices architecture using modern Java and Spring technologies. By leveraging Kafka for event-driven messaging, Kubernetes for orchestration, and best practices for security (JWT, PIN validation), the project aims to showcase senior-level skills in system design, cloud-native development, and modernization of legacy systems, preparing for advanced roles in software engineering.**

### **What is This Project?**
**SecurePay MicroHub is a backend-only microservices system built to manage user authentication and payment workflows, deployed locally on your PC as a simulated cloud environment using Minikube and Docker. It consists of three core services—API Gateway, Auth Service, and Payment Service—interconnected with PostgreSQL for persistent storage, Redis for caching, and Kafka for asynchronous messaging. The system is containerized with Docker and orchestrated on Kubernetes, demonstrating modern software engineering practices suitable for enterprise-grade applications.**

#### **Key Components**:
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to Auth and Payment Services, validates JWT tokens.
- **Auth Service**: Handles user registration (`/register`), generates 24-hour JWT tokens, stores tokens in Redis.
- **Payment Service**: Manages deposits (`/deposit`) and transfers (`/transfer`), validates PINs, publishes transfer events to Kafka.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores user data (`users` table) and transaction data (`balances`, `transactions` tables).
- **Redis**: Caches active JWT tokens for validation and blacklisting.
- **Kafka**: Publishes transaction events (e.g., `{"from": "userA", "to": "userB", "amount": 50}`) for asynchronous processing.
- **Kubernetes (Minikube)**: Orchestrates Docker containers, manages Strimzi Kafka, and exposes services via Ingress (`http://microservices.local`).
- **Docker**: Containerizes each service for deployment.

#### **Key Features**:
- User registration with name, email, phone, and PIN.
- JWT-based authentication with 24-hour token expiration.
- Deposit and transfer operations with PIN validation.
- Asynchronous transaction events via Kafka.
- Scalable deployment on Kubernetes with monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana).

#### **Why It Matters for Seniority**:
- **Technical Mastery**: Showcases Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, and Kubernetes skills, critical for senior roles.
- **Modernization**: Moves beyond legacy conventions with event-driven design and container orchestration.
- **Portfolio Value**: A documented, deployable project impresses recruiters.
- **Interview Readiness**: Prepares you for system design questions (e.g., “Design a payment system with microservices”) and behavioral questions (e.g., “How did you modernize a legacy workflow?”).

### **How to Use This in Your Portfolio**
- **GitHub Repo**: Host SecurePay MicroHub on GitHub with a detailed `README.md` (setup, deployment, API usage).
- **Blog Post**: Write about “Building SecurePay MicroHub: A Cloud-Native Microservices Journey” to highlight challenges and solutions.
- **Resume**: Add under Projects: “SecurePay MicroHub: Designed and deployed a microservices system for secure authentication and payments using Spring Boot,F Kafka, and Kubernetes.”
- **Interview Prep**: Use a UML diagram to explain the architecture, focusing on data flow (e.g., API Gateway → Auth Service → Redis, Payment Service → Kafka).
